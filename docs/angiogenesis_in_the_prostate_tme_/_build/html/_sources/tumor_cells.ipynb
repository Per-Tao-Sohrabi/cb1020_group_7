    "\n",
    "While functionally of the various functions has been confirmed, efficentcy modularity and better integration with paremters of the MainModel are warranted. For instance, the hunger-and eat operations were added at the end when clear logsitics limitations were noticied to not apply to growth. The only way that hypoxia was simulated was by the the Tumor_cell instane's distnace to their nearest endothelial cell. While this asumes the exisitance of a nutrient gradient, it does not directly simulte it. Even the exisitng nutrient count associated with the MainModel instnace does not necessarily form a gradient. Rather hunger due to nutrient deficiency and nutrient deficiency due to gradients are modelled spearaetly. \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model, a new class for nutrients could be created, in which the nutrients are spawned and dispursed away from endothelial cells. In additon, a new class for normal cells with a specifc substrate consumption rate is made for which consumption of nutrient instances that exisit in the same grid cell as themselves is simulated. Since MainModel uses the multigrid class, nutrient can pass cells that contain other agent instances. Those cells containing \"full\" cell agents, progress to migrate to the next cell in where the probability to be consumed would on a macroscopic scale be higher, thereby generating a concentration gradient perpendicular from the endothelial cells.
